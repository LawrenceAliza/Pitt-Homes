Roomy is a student-oriented housing platform based in Pittsburgh, designed to make finding off-campus housing organized, easier, and trusted. Instead of using third-party apps like Facebook or Snapchat, Roomy lets users interact and message each other through the platform, creating a safe environment. Roomy also allows users to browse listings, view photos, and message posters all on one platform.
